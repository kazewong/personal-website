# flowMC is my baby

I often do not like my own creation too much, especially when it comes to papers. 

# Basic of MCMC

# Adaptive proposal with normalizing flow

# Pitfalls

I know (and hope) one day `flowMC` will be replaced something nicer, more performant and flashier. So instead of trying to be the state-of-the-art, I rather position flowMC as a simple baseline.
