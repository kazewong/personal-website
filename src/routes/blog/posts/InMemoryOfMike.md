On March 17, 2025, I learned about the passing of Mike Pascuzzo, a high jump coach I worked with since June 2023.

## 5 lessons I learned from Mike

### High jumpers are Zen

### High jumpers have the toughest mindset of all athletes

### Be nice to yourself

### Best coaching is self coaching

### What worse than not practicing is practicing the wrong thing

## Moving on

I am on the older side of Mike's students, and one thing that keep me going (other than my ambition to go to the Olympics) is Mike would always remind me that his PR was when he was 32, and he tided his PR at age 33. I always said I am not quitting until I beat him and I am 29 at the moment of writing this post. It is unfortunate that he will not be able to witness me beating his PR and going to the Olympics, but now he is not with us, I cannot change my mind and quit before reaching either of those goals. As an athlete, I face countless moments of doubt: I am old, not talented, not training with the best facilities in the world, etc. Yet, I am peron of my word, always have been, to that, I will do everything I can to reach my goals, so one day I can tell Mike's story in front of a camera.
