## How my day looked like

I usually wake up around 0430 these days, in order to eat, digest and let my body temperature raise enough such that I am prepared for our training at 1000. Today (Wednesday) was an off day, so I booked a DEXA scan appointment at 1000 somewhere near downtown San Diego. For the folks who don't know, DEXA scan is a medical imaging test that can measure your body composition (lean mass, fat mass, bone density), and it is considered the golden standard for body composition measurement, especially fat percentage.
Imagine this is an upgraded version of a smart scale or an InBody measurement. I wanted to do this for a while to get a more accurate baseline of my body fat level, such that I can plan my diet and training better.

Before booking the scan, I thought this professional sounding test would be quite expensive and it would be in a clinic. Turns out it was only 50 USD and it was in a van parked on a random street.

The whole procedure was quite quick, took less than 15 minutes from checking in to driving off. It might look shady but it was certainly legit and professional. If you want a calibration point, definitely look up options in your region.

## The result

### Body fat percentage

To be honest I was hoping to have around 15% body fat so I can have an easier time cutting, but the result comes back showing 9.2% body fat, which is quite lean by normal people standard.

In retrospect, by the time of the scan usually I have almost eaten half of my daily calories and drunk quite a bit of water, so in the end I was about 5 lbs heavier than the weight I measured in the morning. The hope is this underestimate my body fat percentage

### Bone density

### Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR)

### What's going on with lean mass?

One thing that I was confused about when I first saw the report was where I was placed in the lean mass distribution.
The lean mass index they quoted in the chart was 18.8 kg/m², which placed me just above the median of the distribution. The question is, how come my lean mass is quite average when my body fat is so low?
