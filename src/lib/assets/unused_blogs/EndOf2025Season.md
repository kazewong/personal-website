## Fail to enter Hong Kong Championship 2025

I found out I couldn't enter the Hong Kong Championship this year today, because I have only cleared 190cm since 2024-01-01.
It seems the lowest entry has jumped 191cm, so

It has been quite a long while I feel

Next time I am back, I don't come back for entering the competition, I come back for the gold.

1. Better nutrition, sleep, and recovery
2. Experiment ways to speed up tempo without sacrificing range
3. Use penultimate to give room for a solid plant
4. Break the speed limiter in my brain
