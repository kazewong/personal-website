I am a research fellow at the Flatiron Institute, mostly spending my time **building codes** to analyze **gravitational-wave** data and studying **black holes**. I also spend a significant amount of time trying to figure out how to use **machine-learning** techniques to answer science questions in **robust and interpretable ways**.

Feel free to use whatever materials you find on this site, but I will greatly appreciate it if you can credit me for the material.
